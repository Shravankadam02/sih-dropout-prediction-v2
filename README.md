# 🎓 AI Dropout Prediction System v2.0

> An intelligent, multi-role platform designed to identify at-risk students, predict dropout probabilities, and facilitate timely interventions using AI and Human-in-the-Loop systems. Developed for the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)**.

---

## 🌟 The Problem
Educational institutions struggle to identify students who are quietly falling behind due to academic pressure, financial issues, or personal stress. By the time a student formally drops out or fails, it is often too late for intervention.

## 🚀 The Solution
This platform uses data analytics and an AI-powered RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chat system to monitor student health metrics (attendance, fee payments, test scores) in real-time. It seamlessly connects students with Mentors and Counsellors before critical thresholds are breached.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🛡️ Multi-Role Architecture:** Dedicated, secure dashboards for Students, Mentors, Counsellors, and Administrators.
- **🤖 AI "Human-in-the-Loop" Chat:** A 24/7 AI Mentor that provides study and mental health support. If the AI detects high distress or cannot confidently help, it autonomously escalates the chat to a human mentor.
- **📊 Predictive Analytics:** Calculates dynamic Risk Scores (Low, Medium, High) based on recent test averages, long-term trends, attendance, and fee status.
- **🔔 Real-Time Notification System:** Mentors and admins receive instant alerts when a student escalates an issue or is newly assigned to their caseload.
- **📈 Comprehensive Admin Overview:** Institution-wide dashboards showing risk distributions, attendance trends, and stale intervention alerts using sleek `Chart.js` visualizations.
- **📂 Bulk Data Ingestion:** Admins and Mentors can rapidly onboard hundreds of students and counsellors via CSV uploads.
